# wxyc-canary

Synthetic-DJ canary that exercises the WXYC user-facing API surface every five minutes from AWS Lambda. Catches outages on the paths a DJ actually touches before a DJ on-air does.

The canary exists because three production incidents on 2026-04-30 (catalog-search 503, flowsheet POST 500, semantic-index decoder drift) were all detected by users hitting them rather than by any monitor. Each one would have surfaced as a CheckFailure metric on this canary within five minutes of going wrong.

## What it checks

| Check                   | Endpoint                                                                                                                                        | Auth             | What it would have caught                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

DJ-auth checks downgrade to `skipped` (a distinct CloudWatch metric, not `failed`) when no DJ credentials are configured, so the alarm doesn't fire on operator-caused gaps. The `lml-auth` check follows the same shape: it skips when no `LML_API_KEY` is configured. The `gha-runner-online` check skips when no GitHub PAT or runner id is configured. The `enrichment-quality` write canary additionally requires `CANARY_ENABLE_WRITE_PROBE=true` and skips when another DJ is on-air — the canary deliberately doesn't inject sentinel rows into a real DJ's flowsheet.

**Paging tier (wxyc-canary#48).** Not every failing check should page on-call. Eight of these checks are user-facing and **page** via `wxyc-canary-check-failure`: `backend-healthcheck`, `proxy-library-search`, `dj-library-search`, `dj-flowsheet-read`, `dj-rotation`, `dj-rotation-picker`, `lml-auth`, and `enrichment-quality` (which pages only when the write probe is enabled and its sentinel insert→enrich→cleanup cycle fails — including the null-metadata / enrichment-timeout shape it exists to catch). Two are infra/CI probes and **don't page** — they route to the low-urgency `wxyc-canary-infra-degraded` alarm instead: `gha-runner-online` (the self-hosted CI runner is an operator concern, not a DJ-on-air path) and `semantic-index-search` (a real explore.wxyc.org availability probe, but it flaps every night ~09:00 UTC on semantic-index sync/rebuild contention, and CloudWatch can't suppress a known time-of-day window). The tier is set by the explicit `pagesOncall` field on each check (default `true`), **not** by suite membership — `dj-rotation` / `dj-rotation-picker` are untagged for CLI reasons but still page. **Accepted gap:** demoting `semantic-index-search` gives up paging coverage of a real surface; the nightly contention is tracked as a separate follow-up to root-cause. **Accepted gap:** the infra tier is **console-only until `InfraAlertEmail` is set** — leaving it empty means `wxyc-canary-infra-degraded` transitions in CloudWatch but notifies nobody.

- One Lambda invocation per schedule. All checks run in parallel; one failure does not short-circuit the others.
- Per-check metrics: `CheckFailure`, `CheckSkipped`, `CheckLatency`, all dimensioned on `Check=<name>`. Plus `EnrichmentLagSeconds` from the v1 write canary (dimensioned + dimensionless). Two dimensionless-only aggregates route failures by paging tier: `UserFacingCheckFailure` and `InfraCheckFailure` (see "Paging tier" above).
- Five alarms: `wxyc-canary-check-failure` (a **user-facing** check failed in 2 of last 3 evaluations → `AlertTopic`), `wxyc-canary-infra-degraded` (an **infra/CI** probe failed, same 2-of-3 window → low-urgency `InfraAlertTopic`), `wxyc-canary-enrichment-lag` (sentinel row took > 30 s to enrich for 3 consecutive evaluations), `wxyc-canary-lambda-errors` (Lambda crashed before publishing metrics), and `wxyc-canary-mutation-4xx-surge` (a sustained surge of 4xx on Backend-Service mutation routes — a `WXYC/BackendService` metric, not a canary check → `AlertTopic`).

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm test          # vitest, fully mocked
npm run typecheck
```

Run the handler against a real environment:

```bash
export CANARY_BACKEND_URL=https://api.wxyc.org
export CANARY_AUTH_URL=https://api.wxyc.org/auth
export CANARY_SEMANTIC_INDEX_URL=https://explore.wxyc.org
export CANARY_PUBLISH_METRICS=false
# Optional, exercises DJ-auth checks:
export CANARY_DJ_EMAIL=canary@wxyc.org
export CANARY_DJ_PASSWORD=...
npm run local
```

## CLI for staging-gate consumers

The same check code that runs in the Lambda is also exposed as a `wxyc-canary` CLI for the [WXYC/wiki#80](https://github.com/WXYC/wiki/issues/80) staging-gate workflows (wxyc-shared `bs-lml-gate.yml`, dj-site `staging-gate.yml`). The CLI runs probes against arbitrary BS/LML URLs — staging, preview, prod — and reports exit codes a GHA workflow can branch on.

### Invocation

```bash
wxyc-canary check \
  --base-url=https://bs-staging.wxyc.org \
  --auth-url=https://bs-staging.wxyc.org/auth \
  --lml-url=https://library-metadata-lookup-staging.up.railway.app \
  --suite=smoke
```

Credentials come from environment variables only (flags would leak into shell history and CI logs):

| Env var              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CANARY_DJ_EMAIL`    | DJ login email. Pairs with `CANARY_DJ_PASSWORD`; when the selected suite includes a DJ-auth check, both must be set together or both unset (XOR is rejected as exit 2). Whitespace-only values are treated as unset. When both unset, DJ-auth checks `skipped` (not fail). |
| `CANARY_DJ_PASSWORD` | DJ login password. See above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `CANARY_LML_API_KEY` | LML bearer for the `lml-auth` check. Without it, the check `skipped`.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `CANARY_ORIGIN_URL`  | Sent as `Origin:` on better-auth calls. Must match a `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` value. Defaults to `https://dj.wxyc.org`.                                                                                                                                               |

`*_SECRET_ARN` and `*_SSM_PARAM` env vars used by the Lambda are **not** read by the CLI. The CLI passes a sanitized env to `runCanary` so an operator with those vars exported in their shell cannot accidentally trigger AWS-SDK calls from a CLI invocation — verified by `test/cli-aws-isolation.test.ts`.

### Suites

| Suite   | Checks included                                                                                     | Use case                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `smoke` | `backend-healthcheck`, `proxy-library-search`, `dj-library-search`, `dj-flowsheet-read`, `lml-auth` | BS+LML staging-gate, dj-site gate-vs-prod |

Lambda-only checks (`gha-runner-online`, `enrichment-quality`, `semantic-index-search`, `dj-rotation`, `dj-rotation-picker`) are unreachable from the CLI by design — they're either prod-only operator concerns, writes, or out-of-scope services. Add a new suite by extending the `Suite` union in `src/types.ts`, appending to `VALID_SUITES` in `src/checks.ts`, and tagging the relevant checks with `suites: [...]`.

### Output

Stdout is exactly one JSON line, parseable by `jq`. The outcome shape is projected to the documented fields below — fields like `metrics` that the Lambda may attach internally are **not** emitted by the CLI, even when a future check returns them:

```json
{
  "suite": "smoke",
  "passed": 4,
  "failed": 0,
  "skipped": 1,
  "outcomes": [
    { "name": "backend-healthcheck", "status": "pass", "latencyMs": 12 },
    { "name": "proxy-library-search", "status": "pass", "latencyMs": 45 },
    { "name": "dj-library-search", "status": "pass", "latencyMs": 67 },
    { "name": "dj-flowsheet-read", "status": "pass", "latencyMs": 22 },
    { "name": "lml-auth", "status": "skipped", "latencyMs": 0, "message": "no LML_API_KEY configured" }
  ]
}
```

`outcomes[i].message` is present only when `status !== 'pass'`. Control characters AND Unicode line separators (U+2028, U+2029, U+0085) in messages are stripped before they reach stderr to neutralize log-injection attempts via probed-endpoint response bodies. The same sanitizer is applied to the fatal-error path (any uncaught throw out of `runCli` runs through `sanitizeForLog` before being written to stderr) so a thrown Error whose message interpolates a server response body cannot bypass the defense.

Stderr is a human-readable summary headline plus a line for every non-pass outcome — readable from a GHA workflow log without piping stdout through `jq`.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0`  | Every check returned `pass` or `skipped`.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `1`  | At least one check returned `fail`. Stdout JSON names the failing check(s); stderr lists them with messages.                                                                                     |
| `2`  | Invocation error (unknown subcommand, missing required flag, unknown flag, unknown suite). Distinct from `1` so the gate workflow can tell "your config is wrong" from "your service is broken". |

### Distribution (e2e-runner consumption)

The CLI is consumed by cloning the repo onto the e2e-runner host during bootstrap:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/wxyc-canary
sudo chown $USER /opt/wxyc-canary
git clone https://github.com/WXYC/wxyc-canary.git /opt/wxyc-canary
cd /opt/wxyc-canary
git checkout <pinned-sha>
npm ci
npm run build:cli
```

Workflows then invoke it as:

```bash
node /opt/wxyc-canary/dist/cli.js check --base-url=... --auth-url=... --lml-url=... --suite=smoke
```

Pinning to a SHA gives consumers an explicit upgrade lever — bump the SHA in the runner-bootstrap script to pick up a non-breaking change; a breaking change forces re-running the bootstrap. The full update procedure lives in the staging-gate runbook ([WXYC/wiki#81](https://github.com/WXYC/wiki/issues/81)).

### Side-effect contract

The CLI never instantiates the AWS SDK. It hard-codes `publishMetrics: false`, doesn't read any `*_SSM_PARAM` or `*_SECRET_ARN` env vars, and never reaches the GitHub-issue-mirroring code path. The Lambda's runner-liveness probe (`gha-runner-online`) and write canary (`enrichment-quality`) stay invisible to the CLI even when a future operator sets the corresponding env vars — they're not in any suite.

## Deploying

### One-time setup

1. Provision a DJ test account in prod auth — `canary@wxyc.org` with the `dj` role and nothing more. Use `POST /auth/admin/provision-user` with an admin session.
2. Store the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager:
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
     --name wxyc-canary-dj-credentials \
     --secret-string '{"email":"canary@wxyc.org","password":"<long random string>"}'
   ```
3. Note the resulting secret ARN; you'll pass it as a parameter to the stack.
4. Decide where alerts go. The simplest path: subscribe an email to the SNS topic via the `AlertEmail` parameter. For Slack, deploy first, then attach a Lambda subscriber that POSTs to a Slack webhook (or use AWS Chatbot).

### First deploy

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
sam build
sam deploy --guided \
  --parameter-overrides \
    DjCredentialsSecretArn=arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:<account>:secret:wxyc-canary-dj-credentials-XXX \
    AlertEmail=ops@wxyc.org \
    EnableWriteProbe=false
```

Leave `EnableWriteProbe=false` for the first deploy. Once the DJ test account is provisioned, the `wxyc-canary-enrichment-lag` alarm is wired to the right SNS subscriber, and you've verified cleanup behaviour in a manual local run (`CANARY_ENABLE_WRITE_PROBE=true npm run local` against a non-prod environment), redeploy with `EnableWriteProbe=true` to turn the write canary on.

### Verifying the write canary in staging

The enrichment-quality check exists to catch the 2026-05-13 class of regression: silent latency-cliff in LML that leaves `youtube_music_url` null on inserts. To validate the alarm wiring before relying on it:

1. In staging, set LML's `discogs_max_concurrent=0` (or otherwise force enrichment failure).
2. Confirm `EnrichmentLagSeconds` climbs and the `wxyc-canary-enrichment-lag` alarm transitions to ALARM within 15 minutes (3 consecutive 5-minute breaches).
3. Revert the LML change. The alarm should return to OK within the next two evaluation periods.

The first invocation runs ~5 minutes after deploy. Confirm via:

```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/wxyc-canary --follow
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace WXYC/Canary --metric-name CheckFailure \
  --dimensions Name=Check,Value=backend-healthcheck \
  --statistics Sum --period 300 \
  --start-time $(date -u -v-1H '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S') \
  --end-time $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
```

### GitHub-issue reporting (optional)

When you want canary failures to land as GitHub issues for morning triage (instead of, or in addition to, SNS email), wire a fine-scoped PAT through SSM Parameter Store and pass two stack parameters. The reporter is best-effort and non-fatal: a GitHub outage never masks the canary's primary signal (the `UserFacingCheckFailure` / `InfraCheckFailure` tier aggregates that back the alarms). SNS + the `wxyc-canary-lambda-errors` alarm stay armed as the fallback for when the Lambda itself dies before the reporter runs.

1. Create a GitHub fine-scoped PAT:
   - Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token.
   - **Resource owner**: `WXYC`. **Repository access**: only the issue target repo (e.g. `WXYC/wxyc-canary`).
   - **Permissions** → **Repository permissions** → **Issues**: Read and write.
   - No other scopes. Set a reasonable expiry and a calendar reminder to rotate.
2. Store it in SSM as a SecureString:
   ```bash
   aws ssm put-parameter \
     --name /wxyc-canary/github-token \
     --type SecureString \
     --value "$PAT" \
     --description "PAT for wxyc-canary to file/close issues. Rotate by overwriting with --overwrite."
   ```
3. Pass both stack parameters on deploy:
   ```bash
   sam deploy \
     --parameter-overrides \
       GitHubTokenSsmParamName=/wxyc-canary/github-token \
       GitHubIssuesRepo=WXYC/wxyc-canary \
       # ...other params
   ```

Behavior per outcome status:

| Outcome   | Reporter action                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fail`    | Open a new issue if none labeled `canary:check:{name}` is open; otherwise comment on the existing issue with the new error message. |
| `pass`    | If an open issue labeled `canary:check:{name}` exists, post a recovery comment and close it (`state_reason: completed`).            |
| `skipped` | No-op. Skipped means an operator-configuration gap (no DJ credentials, write probe disabled), not a regression.                     |

Dedup key is the `canary:check:{name}` label, not the title. Labels are durable across error-message changes; titles drift as the failure mode changes.

To turn off GitHub-issue reporting, redeploy with empty `GitHubTokenSsmParamName` (the conditional in `template.yaml` then removes the SSM IAM grant and env vars).

### Runner liveness probe (`gha-runner-online`)

The `gha-runner-online` check polls the WXYC org's self-hosted GitHub Actions runner that hosts the staging-gate E2E suites (WXYC/wiki#80 phase 1 — see wxyc-shared `scripts/e2e-runner/README.md` for the runner bootstrap + topology). It calls `GET /orgs/WXYC/actions/runners/{id}` every five minutes and fails when `status != "online"`. This check is infra-tier (`pagesOncall: false`), so its failures feed the low-urgency `wxyc-canary-infra-degraded` alarm — not the user-facing page. That alarm's 3 evaluations × 5 min, 2 datapoints-to-alarm window gives the spec's ≥10 minutes of sustained breach.

1. Create a GitHub fine-scoped PAT:
   - Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token.
   - **Resource owner**: `WXYC`. **Repository access**: doesn't matter — this is an org-scoped permission.
   - **Permissions** → **Organization permissions** → **Self-hosted runners**: Read.
   - No other scopes. Set a reasonable expiry and a calendar reminder to rotate.
2. Store it in SSM as a SecureString. Keep it under `/wxyc-canary/*` so it shares the rotation cadence and IAM grant pattern with the GitHub-issues reporter PAT:
   ```bash
   aws ssm put-parameter \
     --name /wxyc-canary/gha-runner-token \
     --type SecureString \
     --value "$PAT" \
     --description "PAT for wxyc-canary runner-liveness probe. Rotate by overwriting with --overwrite."
   ```
3. Discover the runner id (changes on re-registration):
   ```bash
   gh api /orgs/WXYC/actions/runners \
     --jq '.runners[] | select(.name=="wxyc-e2e-runner") | {id, status, labels: [.labels[].name]}'
   ```
4. Pass three stack parameters on the next deploy:
   ```bash
   sam deploy \
     --parameter-overrides \
       GhaRunnerTokenSsmParamName=/wxyc-canary/gha-runner-token \
       GhaRunnerOrg=WXYC \
       GhaRunnerId=<id from step 3> \
       # ...other params
   ```

When the runner is replaced (instance swap or re-registration), repeat step 3 and redeploy with the new `GhaRunnerId`. The check will fail with a 404-flavoured message until the parameter is re-set — that's intentional, since a stale `GhaRunnerId` is itself a real signal the operator should fix.

To turn the probe off, redeploy with an empty `GhaRunnerTokenSsmParamName` or `GhaRunnerId=0`. The conditional in `template.yaml` then strips the SSM IAM grant and the env vars; the check downgrades to `skipped` and the alarm stays quiet.

### CI deploys

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds + deploys on push to `main`. Required GitHub secrets:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` — same shape as Backend-Service
- `DJ_CREDENTIALS_SECRET_ARN` — the ARN from step 2 above

Required GitHub variables (override defaults if needed):

- `BACKEND_URL`, `AUTH_URL`, `SEMANTIC_INDEX_URL`, `ALERT_EMAIL`
- `INFRA_ALERT_EMAIL` — optional low-urgency recipient for `wxyc-canary-infra-degraded` (the infra/CI tier, wxyc-canary#48). Leave unset for console-only; set it to a filtered alias to get non-paging email. An empty value is an accepted gap, not a silent one.

Optional GitHub variables for the runner-liveness probe (when all three are set the next deploy enables `gha-runner-online`; leave unset to keep it skipped):

- `GHA_RUNNER_TOKEN_SSM_PARAM_NAME` — SSM SecureString path that the operator has populated, e.g. `/wxyc-canary/gha-runner-token`. Defaults empty → probe disabled.
- `GHA_RUNNER_ORG` — defaults to `WXYC`.
- `GHA_RUNNER_ID` — numeric runner id from `gh api /orgs/WXYC/actions/runners`. Defaults to `0` → probe disabled.

## Operating runbook

### Alarm fires: `wxyc-canary-check-failure`

This is the **user-facing-outage page** — a DJ-facing surface has been failing for ~10 minutes. (Infra/CI probes route to `wxyc-canary-infra-degraded` instead; see below.)

1. Open CloudWatch → Metrics → `WXYC/Canary` → `CheckFailure`, filtered to the `Check` dimension, to see which surface is broken. (The alarm itself reads the dimensionless `UserFacingCheckFailure` aggregate, which names the tier but not the specific check — the dimensioned `CheckFailure` is the drill-down.)
2. Tail the canary log: `aws logs tail /aws/lambda/wxyc-canary --since 30m`. Each invocation prints a JSON line with all check outcomes.
3. Reproduce the failing endpoint manually (the `description` column above tells you the URL).
4. If the failure is real, page the on-call. If the canary itself is buggy, file an issue and disable the check by removing it from `src/checks.ts`.

### Alarm fires: `wxyc-canary-infra-degraded`

The low-urgency infra/CI tier (wxyc-canary#48) — `gha-runner-online` or `semantic-index-search` has been failing for ≥10 minutes. This does **not** page; it notifies `InfraAlertTopic` only (and only when `InfraAlertEmail` is subscribed). Check the dimensioned `CheckFailure` to see which probe fired.

- **`semantic-index-search`** — explore.wxyc.org's Graph API is 5xx'ing or returning a malformed envelope. If the timestamp is the nightly ~09:00 UTC window, this is most likely the known semantic-index sync/rebuild contention on the t3.small (the tracked follow-up) — confirm and move on. Off-window or sustained failures mean a real explore.wxyc.org outage; check the semantic-index EC2 host and logs.
- **`gha-runner-online`** — the staging-gate runner has been failing its liveness probe. The check message distinguishes the failure mode — route accordingly:
  - **`offline`** — the runner process stopped polling GitHub. SSH to `wxyc-e2e-runner` (per wxyc-shared `scripts/e2e-runner/README.md`) and check `systemctl status 'actions.runner.*.service'`. If the host itself is unreachable, the EC2 instance is wedged — reboot or rebuild from the bootstrap script.
  - **`404 — runner was likely replaced (or PAT lacks Self-hosted runners: Read scope)`** — two-step diagnosis: (1) Confirm the runner id is still current with `gh api /orgs/WXYC/actions/runners --jq '.runners[] | select(.name=="wxyc-e2e-runner")'`. If the id changed, redeploy with the new `GhaRunnerId`. (2) If the id is unchanged, the PAT is missing the `Self-hosted runners: Read` org-level permission — GitHub returns 404 to hide resources from underprivileged tokens. Generate a fresh fine-scoped PAT with the correct scope and overwrite `/wxyc-canary/gha-runner-token`.
  - **`GitHub rate limit exceeded — the PAT is valid`** — do NOT rotate the PAT. The 5000/hr REST bucket is shared across everything the PAT identity touches; wait for the reset epoch in the message and investigate any other tooling that may share the token.
  - **`GitHub API degraded`** — check [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com) before SSHing the runner or rotating anything. The runner is fine; GitHub itself is the problem.
  - **`PAT rejected with 401`** — the SSM-stored PAT was revoked, expired, or malformed. Generate a fresh fine-scoped PAT (Self-hosted runners: Read on `WXYC`) and overwrite `/wxyc-canary/gha-runner-token` via `aws ssm put-parameter --overwrite`.
  - **`PAT rejected with 403`** — same remediation as 401, but only after ruling out the rate-limit message (which also surfaces as 403).

### Alarm fires: `wxyc-canary-lambda-errors`

The Lambda crashed before it could publish per-check metrics. Usually means a config error (missing env, bad secret), an AWS SDK retry storm, or an unhandled exception. Check the most recent log stream for the stack trace.

### A check is too noisy

False positives on a check usually mean its assertion is too tight (e.g., expecting at least 1 row when the table is legitimately empty during low-traffic periods). Loosen the assertion in `src/checks.ts`, write a regression test, redeploy. Don't suppress alerts at the alarm level — that's a slippery slope.

### Adding a new check

Add a new entry to the `checks` array in `src/checks.ts`. The check name becomes a CloudWatch metric dimension, so use kebab-case and keep it stable (renaming it breaks any dashboard that pinned to the old name). Write a test in `test/handler.test.ts` covering both pass and fail shapes.

## Why these specific checks

The check set is deliberately small. Each one corresponds to a real production failure mode that has happened or has plausibly close-relatives. Don't add checks speculatively — every check is an alarm risk surface, and a noisy canary gets ignored. If a new failure mode shows up that the existing checks don't catch, add a check then.

Things this canary does **not** do, on purpose:

- **No writes against another DJ's show.** The v1 write canary (`enrichment-quality`) is gated three ways: `CANARY_ENABLE_WRITE_PROBE=true` must be set, DJ credentials must be configured, and the check skips when another DJ is on-air. The last one is non-negotiable — even if the alarm is on the line, a sentinel row in a real DJ's flowsheet is worse than a missed metric.
- **No iOS-side decoder testing.** The semantic-index check confirms the server returns the right shape, not that iOS decodes it correctly. iOS decoder tests live in `wxyc-ios-64`.
- **No latency SLOs on the read-side checks.** The `CheckLatency` metric is published for trend visibility, not alerting — read-side latency targets are downstream of upstream API behaviour and would mostly produce noise. The `EnrichmentLagSeconds` SLO is the exception: it's measured against the canary's own controlled insert, so a 30 s threshold is meaningful.

## Costs

At the default 5-minute cadence: ~8,640 invocations/month, all under 5 seconds, 256 MB. Lambda cost ~$0.02/month. CloudWatch metrics + alarms ~$1/month. SNS ~$0. Total: under $2/month.
